# EFFICIENT-ALGORITHM-FOR-CAR-EVALUTION-DATABASE-USING-WEKA
In this project we are using weka tool for analyzing the efficiency of different algorithm.Weka tool can be useful for calculating the efficiency of the data set and obtaining better results.The results obtained will be helpful in analyzing the data set.The classification algorithm used are listed below-

C4.5
Bayes Net
S.M.V
Apriori
k-nearest neighbor classifier
AdaBoost
KStar

DATA SET DESCRIPTION

1. Title: Car Evaluation Database

3. Past Usage:

The hierarchical decision model, from which this dataset is derived, was first presented in M. Bohanec and V. Rajkovic: Knowledge acquisition and explanation for multi-attribute decision making. In 8th Intl Workshop on Expert Systems and their Applications, Avignon, France. pages 59-78, 1988.


   Within machine-learning, this dataset was used for the evaluation
   of HINT (Hierarchy INduction Tool), which was proved to be able to
   completely reconstruct the original hierarchical model. This,
   together with a comparison with C4.5, is presented in

   function decomposition. ICML-97, Nashville, TN. 1997 (to appear)
